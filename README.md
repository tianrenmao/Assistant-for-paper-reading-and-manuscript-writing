# Assistant-for-paper-reading-and-manuscript-writing

 ===========================
 
Motivation

=> When reading literatures: 

Too many papers, cannot get the information considered important by the scientist community

Missing important conclusion that have been drawn 

Don’t know the widely studied directions of your field 

=> When writing Introduction and Disscussion: 

Cannot give a global view of background 

Cannot list important projects that have been done 

Missing important previous conclusions related to your study

 ===========================
 
RWA’s goal

To let you know: 

A global view of important information that was frequently mentioned by scientists

Important directions of your field Projects that have been done 

Previous conclusions that you should considered in your studying and writing

 ===========================
 
What does RWA do?

Extract and sort important information using frequency-based information sorting (FIS) strategy

The output important_word.txt contains high frequency keywords of abstracts, representing important research directions.

The output important_sentence.txt contains high-score sentences, representing common background information, projects that have been done and important conclusions that have been drawn.

The output important_sentence_grouped.txt contains grouped sentences based on originating references, which help understanding and writing manuscript (especially Introduction and Discussion).

 ===========================
 
You can also try it for a new research field to know important information ASAP.


Don’t want to be lost in the sea of information? Try RWA!

 ===========================
 
 Usage:
 
1. Customize your search on PubMed with keywords, journal names, publishing year etc.

2. Download abstracts (just click "send to") in the format of Medline (had better be >100 abstract) and name the file as abstract_medline.txt.

3. Put the program at the same folder and double click it. Enjoy it!
